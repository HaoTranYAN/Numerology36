An especially high level of spirituality surrounds this Ruling Birth Number, offering those born to it a unique potential for developing the awareness of the high self. Unfortunately, more people fail to live up to this potential power than develop it, but this pattern is changing with the rapid approach of the New Age of enlightenment (New Age). Though we do not find many Ruling Birth Number 11’s as most of the other numbers, they certainly proliferate in domains where personal growth and spiritual up liftment predominate (and they will all be reading this book!). In practice, only two birth date totals commonly qualify for Ruling Birth Number 11 – that is, 29 and 38 – though an occasional birth date total of 47 will be found.

These people are among the few who are potentially best equipped to guide humanity into the emerging age of awareness. It is a very responsible incarnation they have chosen. Unfortunately, many find that they are enticed (through their basic self) by life’s physical attractions and are thus diverted from their higher purpose. But the tide is changing as the real values of life gain credence over manipulation and the false prophets.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Best Expression</b></color>

As lovers of refinement, beauty and the cultural values of life, Ruling Birth Number 11 people naturally gravitate toward such an environment because it liberates them to express their innate beauty and spirituality. Material life, for them, can be demanding and uninteresting (unless they choose to live under their Day Number – see Chapter 8 – or give in to peer-group pressure). But they have to learn to balance the material with the ideals they seek within to realise that the noblest of spiritual virtues is of little value unless it can be employed to improve the quality of life. No finer expression can be found than in doing this.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Distinctive Traits</b></color>

There are extreme differences between the lifestyles of the Ruling Birth Number 11’s who live positively and utilise their exceptional spiritual powers and the negative counterpart whose life appears difficult and colourless. An uncompromisingly high level of morality and ethics, a profoundly reliable intuitiveness, and an inspired driving force are clearly in evidence when these people are involved in spiritually-oriented pursuits. When they are living naturally they are deeply feeling people, extremely dependable, honest and just, with a deep love for family and friends and a sincere compassion for all life.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Negative Tendencies to Be Surmounted</b></color>

The temptation to abdicate our responsibility for virtuous living becomes stronger as modern commercialism seeks new and more devious avenues to flog its overproduction of often unnecessary commodities. Life is meant to be far less complicated, far more harmonious than many people currently realise. Such complexities can easily confuse and misdirect people from their path. When this occurs, they tend to become bitter and spiteful, often indifferent in their attitude toward other people and their work. When it occurs in the life of a Ruling Birth Number 11, they become lost and apathetic, finding little solace in the material world into which they have become enticed. They must employ great awareness and care to be firm in their resolve to keep to their path, for it will not be difficult so long as they take unbiased note of their profound intuition.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Recommended Development</b></color>

Spiritual faculties do not easily mix with commerce for the Ruling Birth Number 11. Consequently, their best avenues for expression lie in those professions that facilitate growth in spiritual awareness and give substance to their noble sensitivities. At the same time, adequate monetary rewards are essential, so a compromise is often in order. With their natural generosity and sensitivity to the needs of others, Ruling Birth Number 11’s often find an above-average demand on their financial resources. They have to learn not only the most practical means of expressing their spirituality, but also to be guided by intuition rather than motivated by base desires (such as for recognition, reward or return favours). The practice of such disciplines as discrimination, temperance and fortitude will significantly assist them. They are often tempted to reject assistance for themselves when in need, but must learn to be more receptive and to recognise the benefits that can accrue from such practical cooperation.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Most Suitable Vocations</b></color>

Educators, social workers, religious leaders and personal growth instructors are often found to be Ruling Birth Number 11’s. Others capably turn to the teaching of cultural subjects, exploration and the field of professional performing, so long as their roles have underlying moral values. Their intuition can also qualify them to become amazing designers or inventors.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Summary</b></color>

Sensitive, feeling and caring people are the Ruling Birth Number 11’s. They love refinement, beauty and everything with a depth of cultural substance; and are intensely honest and compassionate, often preferring to avoid the life of hard business, for they are generally not competent money managers.
