  "text": "Personal Year 7: Inner Search\n\nYear 7 can be difficult, but necessary to your personal growth. The year comes with many changes emotionally. These changes may be with friendships, romantic relationships, your workplace, within your home, or even your own soul.\n\nThis cycle is for you to learn to use your internal resources to face problems rather than leaning on others."
