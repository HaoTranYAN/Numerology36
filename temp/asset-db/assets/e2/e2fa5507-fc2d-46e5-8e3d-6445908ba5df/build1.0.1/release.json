            "If your soul urge number is 22 then your inner urge is to leave a mark on this world in some way. In which area, it is up to you.\n\nIt may be the financial world, it may spirituality, it may even be political.\n\nSoul number 22 possesses the power and intuitive understanding of the heart’s desire number 11. But not only that. It also has the practical aptitude of number 4. Together, these qualities make a potent mix.\n\nAnyone with 22 in their name is set for making a positive and remarkable impact on the planet. However, your path may not always be an easy one. With huge potential comes huge responsibility.\n\nAnd people will hold you up to scrutiny, out of admiration and envy. But don’t let that hold you back. You know why you’re here, on this planet. Have the courage to follow what your heart’s desire number is telling you."
