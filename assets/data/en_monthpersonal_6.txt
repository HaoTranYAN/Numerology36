Family, Love & Domestic Responsibility
Being responsible is the theme for a 6 month- especially related to home, relationships, and family. Make time for those needing your assistance, attention, or time. Spend quality time with your kids. Unresolved issues from the past may resurface again. You’re not going to be able to sweep them under the rug. Address them. It’s another chance to improve your relationships and to focus on giving and receiving love.
