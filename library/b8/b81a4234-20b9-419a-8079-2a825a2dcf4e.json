  "text": "When the number 9 is missing from one's name, the person has the karmic lesson number 9. The number signifies responsibility and wisdom. People with this number have a mission or a goal to make the world a better place to live in. This number denotes service to humanity.\n\nNumber 9 represents the 'earthly lesson' which denotes \"mercy\". Thus these people work towards the good of others. They have a protective energy in their soul.\n\nThese people learn throughout their life to be tolerant, altruistic, generous and compassionate. This person will show great strength of character, acumen, sensitivity and idealism.\n\nThey tend to be homely and caring towards their family and friends. They need to learn to be less egocentric. There will be times when they will need to sacrifice for the good of others.\n\nThey need to view life on a larger scale as they are here to serve humanity. They have the potential to be able to influence the fate of themselves and others for the good, but they do not realize it themselves. Thus at times they refrain from advancing any social cause.\n\nThe effect of this lesson reduces if number 9 is present in any of the core numbers (Life Path, Birthday, Expression, Hearts Desire, or Personality Number)."
