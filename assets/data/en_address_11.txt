11 is the Master Number of Intuition and Illumination. The number 11 shaped like two pillars, representing a gateway of new growth for you. When you live in an 11 home, you will be inspired with new ideas, creativity, and innovation. You will find many rich and rewarding opportunities, especially those that promote leadership and creativity.

Since this is a number of light, you will want to design your home with beautiful airy decor. Keep it uncluttered, and decorate it with meaningful artifacts. 11 reduces to the number 2 (1+1 = 2) therefore this can promote harmony, provided that each person maintains their independence.

Challenges: Because 11 is a master number, there are spiritual tests that you must go through. 11 is a number of partnership and can promote harmony ONLY if both people are aligned with their truth and maintain a strong sense of self. If you are codependent in any way, or give your power away, you will find yourself getting into relationship struggles.

This is to teach you to be interdependent in relationships, rather than co-dependent. Since you will be flooded with intuitive insights in this home, you want to make sure you EXPRESS your creativity, or else you might feel anxious or confused. You must act on your ideas, not just think about them.
