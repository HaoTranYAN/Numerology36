            "Freedom is an essential element for your happiness to be complete. You love traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people, trying new things. Whenever a new idea comes to you, it gets you excited and your enthusiasm is infectious. This is a valuable leadership ability and one that you must work to continually cultivate and develop.\n\nBe careful in your pursuit of change and be mindful of where your desire for freedom leads you. This part of your nature can make you extremely impetuous. This is especially true when it comes to finishing things you start. The goal can become an obsession that keeps you from seeing how to best to achieve it and that will tend to frustrate you. Frustration can only hold you back and that sense of disappointment can make you become very reserved emotionally. Don't be afraid to release the passion that wells up within you. Fives are very passionate, they just have trouble finding appropriate outlets for their passion. When you find them, you will be unstoppable."
