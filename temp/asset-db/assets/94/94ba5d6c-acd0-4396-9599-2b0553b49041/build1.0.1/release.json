Number 3 and Number 7 are well-suited in terms of a romantic relationship.  After the initial attraction, it will not be long before Number 7 and Number 3 become serious about each other.  Number 7 will typically fall head over heels in love with Number 3, and it is the sort of obvious display of passion and love that Number 3 thrives on.  Number 3 will be more than happy to return the attentions of Number 7, and they will have a very romantic relationship.\n\nThe only real difficulty that this couple is likely to experience will arise through their difference in attitude towards social events.  Number 3 lives for social events, Number 3 lives for social interaction and will want to make the most of every invitation.  Number 7, on the other hand, is a more private person and less likely to enjoy a hectic result in Number 3 attending social functions alone.  The danger here is that Number 3 will have the opportunity to flirt.  Number 7 could become quite insecure and jealous if Number 3 is out with other people most of the time.  To avoid such difficulties, Number 3 and Number 7 should try to compromise and strike a balance between socializing and spending time alone together.  If they are able to manage their spare time so that they are both happy, then they are likely to be enamoured with each other for a very long time.\n\nThere will be a dream-like quality about their relationship, and they will have few quarrels as neither is argumentative by nature.\n"
