Your heart's desire is to make your mark â€“ to leave something behind that the world will remember. This mark can be political, philosophical, financial or otherwise. You have the combined characteristics of the numbers in your numerological makeup. You have all the Master capabilities present in 11 and you have the practical reasoning skills of the 4. This truly makes you the master of your own destiny and shields you from impetuous actions. The mark you make on this world will be a positive one. Your nature won't have it any other way.

The path of the 22 is never easy. It comes with a huge weight of responsibility. Take that responsibility seriously but don't be so preoccupied with other people's perceptions that it makes you too guarded. Living an extraordinary life takes a huge amount of courage and it requires having the ability to deal with scrutiny. As many people will feel threatened by you as will admire you. This is the mark of a true visionary so learn to embrace both.
