Your destiny is to achieve a higher state of consciousness and teach others how to achieve theirs.

Your mission is a humanitarian one.  Yours is a spiritual path and you’re here to love unconditionally, however that may manifest in your life. You’re often a hopeless romantic at heart and can set yourself up for disappointment when people don’t measure up to your ideals.   You’re at your optimal when you’re tapping into your creativity, sensitivity, and selflessness.

Beware that others may find that you’re ideas are a little on the cuckoo-side! This Destiny number is a powerful one demanding that you learn to transform and heal (both yourself and others) while letting go of the past freely and without bitterness. 

You may find yourself tripping over into the arena of resentment, of intolerance, or gullibility.  You may have to deal with enmeshment with your family of origin throughout your life. Your task is to let go of family issues fully and completely.  You often feel either resentment toward the family or feel overly responsible for them.

You need to be aware that people respond much more favorably to you when you connect with them through being a compassionate active listener rather than a preacher, lecturer, or proselytizer. Understand that you can have an intimidating quality to you, despite your big heart.  So be careful about how your frame your discussion so that people don’t feel as though you’re patronizing them. 

Often the 9 Destiny number can come off as arrogant or unapproachable.  Realize that everyone thinks you have it all (or have it all together) and so you find it difficult to ask for help or support.  It’s not only okay to ask for help, it’s very healing for you.  Know that your 9 Destiny is a profound journey that offers you multifaceted opportunities to touch the lives of others and heal some of your own deepest wounds.  You’re learning how to both give and receive.
