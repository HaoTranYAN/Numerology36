  "text": "Number 6 resonates with everything good about humanity—compassion, truth, justice, and balance. Hence, those whose combination results in mobile number 6 are likely to spread love and compassion in their conversations with other people; these are the people willing to offer free service. \n\nIf you have this number, you’ll be bombarded with calls from people seeking care and comfort.\n\nDue to the loving and caring energy of number 6, it’s perfectly suited for medical workers, counselors, teachers, and those into spiritual-based practices or heart-based business.  Some people consider 6 as one of the minor numbers because of its low-key nature but don’t be fooled."
