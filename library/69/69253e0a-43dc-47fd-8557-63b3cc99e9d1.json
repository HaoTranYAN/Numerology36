Your destiny is to become a powerful healer and bring love and unity to your corner of the planet. You truly are here to make a difference.\n\nYou can achieve this great mission through persuasion, love, and compassion. You need to focus on bringing people together rather than picking sides or amplifying divisions. You’re naturally giving and caring, and you always want to see the best in others. When you do so, other people want to impress you. They want to earn your good opinion. You will struggle with the burdens you place upon yourself, but this is your path.\n\nYour life path will take you from being popular and well liked to helping and healing to leading and inspiring, all for a greater good."
