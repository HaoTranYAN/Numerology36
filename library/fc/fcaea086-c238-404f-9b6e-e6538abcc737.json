Neither party can accept another person trying to dictate to them, and this could be the source of much disharmony.\n\nNumber 4's temper could give Number 1 reason to doubt the suitability of the match and may lead to a permanent rift.  Number 4 should learn to manage anger in a way that does not create conflict in the relationship.\n\nBy nature, both Number 1 and Number 4 are reluctant to be open about their emotions and so the relationship between the two may seem to lack open affection.\n\nNumber 1 and Number 4 should try to trust their partner and to be honest about how they are feeling.\n\nThis is a relationship that needs to be worked at to succeed long term, but if the effort is put in, then it could be rewarding for both parties.\n"
