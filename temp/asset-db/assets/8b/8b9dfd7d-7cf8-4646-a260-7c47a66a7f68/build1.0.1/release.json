            "Those who have number 8 lacking in their names have karmic lesson number 8. These people are normally able to do well in business and thus are able to bring in good amounts of money. However, they also have to go through ups and downs as they are not able to handle their resources properly due to lack of cautiousness.\n\nThese people are very independent and self-regulating and thus do not like to be told to do things and thus always have a tiff with the person who holds authority. This arises from a dogged behavior that thwarts them from understanding their limitations. In their adulthood these people tend to focus on the pursuit of money and status and leave behind valuable relationships. Thus they may seem shallow and materialistic.\n\nThese people need to know how to manage their money. It is likely that these people will possess enough money but will always have a tendency to spend it rather than save any of it. This lesson guides a person on knowing their boundaries, and also the need of limiting their expenditure. They also need to learn to be well-organized.\n\nThe effect of this karmic lesson number reduces if number 8 is present once or more number of times in their birthday, or destiny number."
