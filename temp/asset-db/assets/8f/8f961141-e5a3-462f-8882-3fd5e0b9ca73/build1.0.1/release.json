            "People with number 4 missing in their names have karmic lesson number 4. These people tend to be confused about their career. They find it difficult to find an employment that is gratifying. This may result in an indifference towards work.\n\nIn their childhood people with karmic lesson number 4 have mostly had their opportunities thwarted by financial issues. When they grow older they become irresponsible towards work. They are irrational and disorganized towards life that makes it difficult for them to understand what they do best.\n\nPeople with karmic lesson number 4 need to establish a disciplined approach towards life. They should lay a foundation for their life.\n\nThey look for solution to their problems outside of them rather than within. They start new jobs with the hope that it will be exciting but when it turns out to be only work without any glamour they turn away from it. They need to learn to concentrate and focus and be less frivolous.\n\nIf this number 4 features once or more in any of the other core numbers of this person such as Birthday, or Life Path then the effect of the karmic lesson number decreases."
