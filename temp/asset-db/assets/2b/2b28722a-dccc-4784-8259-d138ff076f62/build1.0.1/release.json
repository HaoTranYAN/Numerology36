            "Your destiny is to bring people together in an atmosphere of harmony and love.\n\nYour mission is to create harmony, balance, cooperation, and love wherever you go and in whatever you do.  Love is the cornerstone to your life and finding that perfect mate is important to you. You’re here to learn how to develop your sense of relationship;  how to successfully understand and relate to others and to yourself. \n\nYour path includes developing diplomacy.  Your 2 Destiny encourages you to seek to be of service to the “larger cause;” whether that’s your family, your company, or any other cause or group you feel strongly about.  Your destiny is to develop adaptability, open- hearted caring, and focus on the higher good.  Understand that you need to get out and socialize, because when you isolate yourself, you suffer from pessimism, depression, and inaction. \n\nYou thrive when you’re involved with other people and contributing to the group dynamics, whether it’s with friends, work, family, or a community group. You’ll be tested with being overly sensitive and can resort to becoming confrontational rather than the harmonizer.  Beware of needing incessant reinforcement from everyone around you, because you’re not likely to get it!  Even if you find that you’re challenged with being passive or aggressive—indecisive or lacking focus—your calling is to become a peacemaker and harmonizing influence on whatever you touch."
