  "text": "You are all about making spirituality accessible. Conscientious, pragmatic, humble, and stubborn, you are drawn toward the spiritual side of life. At the same time, you also seek material projects, clarity, and everyday progress. As a master number, you have a humanitarian mission in life: to build projects that will benefit everyone.\n\nYou have all the attributes of a number 4 (you’re practical, steady, hardworking), but you’re destined to use them for something much bigger. You wrestle with this responsibility and the degree of exposure and even ~fame~ it brings. Part of you yearns to live a quieter life.\n\nYour life path will take you from using your practicality for your own enterprises into building amazing tools, services, products, and platforms for others."
