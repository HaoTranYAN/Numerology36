  "text": "Your destiny is to become #1 at all you do in your life.\n\nYour task is to develop your true, authentic self and to become in leader in whatever field you find you’re the most passionate and skilled.  You’re all about power.  You want to be the best at everything you do. You expect very high standards of performance from yourself and, in turn, also expect the same from others, which can set you up for frustration and disappointment.\n\nYour purpose is to take the lead and take initiative—the 1 Destiny number is not lack-luster or low-key! You’re meant to have courage, act independently on your unique and original ideas, be innovative, and take charge.  All this while communicating and acting with clarity and compassion. \n\nA 1 Destiny number sets you up for a lifetime of development of your sense of self (banish that sense of self-doubt), your willpower, and setting out with determination without allowing the naysayers or glitches along the road weigh you down or demolish your vision. You work hard and play hard.  You need to have an exercise routine that helps you burn off excess stress.\n\nYour 1 Destiny number insists that even if you struggle with self confidence or hold yourself back from manifesting your full powers, you’re lined up for a destiny that demands that you embrace leadership.  You need to demonstrate your originality and leadership and also teach it to others.  The 1 Destiny number will demand that you develop yourself from a dependence to independence, individuation, and – ultimately – achievement and initiative."
