The good news though, is that you can make amends for this life path number by participating in active reasoning and communication.\n\nAlways think about your actions and the resulting repercussions. And since number 13 represents laziness, you should look to get out of your comfort zone in this life. Therefore, try to work hard to get out of your comfort zone, putting extra effort into your activities.
