            "People who have number 3 missing in their names have their karmic lesson number as 3. These people tend to be self-critical. They are not able to handle attention and find some flaw or else in their conduct. These people set an incredible standard of excellence that they want to reach.\n\nThey need to learn to lighten up and be less critical of themselves. These people should learn to understand that their self criticism need to be controlled. Thus they should enjoy themselves more. They also tend to be shy and introvert.\n\nShirk off all the seriousness and be more buoyant and optimistic towards life, and share the joy with others.\n\nThese people are also not very attentive because of emotional disturbances or plain boredom. When they are adult they are perceived as eccentric or arrogant and thus are not taken seriously by others.\n\nThey are talented but life will also put challenges that will need them to be more expressive. These people are generally artists who will have to work persistently to achieve success.\n\nIf this number is present in any of the other core numbers of this person even once then the effect of karmic lesson lessens."
