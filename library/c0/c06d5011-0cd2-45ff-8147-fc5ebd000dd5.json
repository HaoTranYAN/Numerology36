  "text": "In the numerology chart, 19 is centered around selfishness and the need to step on people to achieve your personal goals or interests. In the journey of your past birth cycle, you didnâ€™t hesitate to use people in order to get ahead. And while you were a bully in your previous birth cycle, you can change your destiny by becoming more of a laid-back leader who allows the other to take charge and be of service to other people.\n\nThe whole idea is to be more accommodating and be of service to other people, taking time to think about the issues plaguing both friend and family before yourself. You should also resist the urge to act like a know-it-all since it promotes a sense of arrogance and conceit.\n\nIf you are struggling with this number, you`ll notice that you have a lot of love for material goods in your birth life. Number 19 is also associated with stubbornness (especially when it comes to asking for help), obsession in self-appearance, narcissism, over-reliance on one, addiction, idleness, arrogance, selfishness, and self-esteem issues (especially when things fail to go according to plan).\n\nDisclaimer, overcoming this number is fairly difficult and can take multiple lives. But to be on the right side and change the course of your life, it is important to prioritize caring for other people. That is, helping your colleagues and the less-fortunate to succeed in their personal ventures. It`s human nature to think that you`re better than someone or something else, but the fact is there are several ways we can all add value provided we work towards achieving our goals."
