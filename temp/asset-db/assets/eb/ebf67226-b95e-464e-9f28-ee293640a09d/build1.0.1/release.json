            "You’re all about healing through creativity. You’re imaginative, empathetic, nurturing, shy, healing, and artistic. Your master number is made up of a double 1 (representing leadership and power) and a 2 (representing collaboration and healing). You will often feel conflicted or torn about your purpose, like you want to lead but also follow or like you want to step into the spotlight but also hide in the shadows. Overcoming your inner turmoil is a major part of your life story.\n\nYour life is sometimes a struggle because you feel drawn to lead and be at the center of things, but your ego is vulnerable and you feel like an impostor sometimes. You have to appreciate that your gifts are unique and need to be shared.\n\nYour life path is to recognize and use your creativity, intuition, and healing abilities for the benefit of humanity as a whole—be it through healing, teaching, writing, or the arts. Through it all, you are always destined for success and achievement. Your resilience grows exponentially as you push yourself toward this fate."
