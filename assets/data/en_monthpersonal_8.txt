Money, Career, Personal Power (yeah, baby)
Don’t get too ahead of yourself thinking it’s time to go on a shopping spree! Yes, it’s a money month, but it’s also a time to budget and to get your finances in order. A career opportunity may present itself or there may be a chance to attract money. It is a good time to make career moves. Be ambitious, take action, stand up for yourself. Adopt an attitude of abundance and be positive, because 8 is the number of manifestation.
