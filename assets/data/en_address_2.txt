This home is sure to be a loving, cozy atmosphere, where others will always feel welcome, nurtured, and loved. The energy of 2 is sentimental and sensitive. So, this is a lovely place for those who enjoy being surrounded by photographs of family and friends, and having people over for intimate gatherings, especially where feelings are expressed and affection is shared.

It is a wonderful place for couples who love to do things together. It is particularly well-suited for romantic partners, best friends, and young families. Since the 2 energy fosters intuition and balance, this home is also well-suited for writers and healers.

Challenges: Since the 2 lends itself to strong feelings, sometimes people can feel overly sensitive here. You can feel overwhelmed with emotions and need to go outside or do more physical activities to ground you. You can find yourself taking things too personally or needing constant affection or validation.

If you are living with someone else, you might find there is an imbalance of give and take. You can balance this energy by remembering to have healthy boundaries and express your feelings openly and directly as they come up.
