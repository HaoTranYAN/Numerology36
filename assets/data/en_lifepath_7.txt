Sevens are naturally curious and as a result find themselves devoted to investigating the unknown. However, you possess all of the skills to handle this challenge. You have a refined and analytical mind that is capable of great insight. Where others see only broken pieces, Sevens see a puzzle waiting to be solved. You are a strong mix of intellectual creativity and practical logic.

When your life is stable, you are the life of the party. You are charming, witty and able to present a unique spin on conversational topics. Your holistic perspective makes you an incredibly interesting dinner guest. Sevens have a natural ability to learn, analyze, and seek answers to life’s important questions, which will carry them far in life.

However, this same analytical and inquisitive mind can also lead to a life of solitude and loneliness. You need uninterrupted time to contemplate your ideas without other people’s thoughts clouding your judgment. Sevens prefer to work alone, valuing their space and privacy. However, when given too much space, Sevens can develop an egocentric, selfish and conceited streak.

Sevens have the potential for enormous growth and to go far in life. Invest time and effort into companionship and deeper relationships. Social interactions enhance your perspective on yourself and on life and should not be undervalued.
