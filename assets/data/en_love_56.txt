Number 5 is likely to find Number 6 attractive because of their ability to stand out from the crowd.  Number 5 will be determined to get to know Number 6 better and will arrange for a future meeting.

Number 6 should be wary of having too high an expectation of a union with Number 5.  Number 5 will probably just be looking for a brief affair rather than any form of long-term commitment.  There is a strong possibility that Number 6 could be hurt by Number 5 and feel rejected if Number 5 drifts off.  Number 6 should think very carefully before becoming involved with Number 5.

Number 5 and Number 6 are not really very compatible in terms of romance.  Number 5 is unpredictable and alternative, and Number 6 is far more traditional.  Number 6 may well begin to feel out of their depth if they try to keep up with Number 5.  Number 5 is constantly on the lookout for change and excitement, which goes against the grain for Number 6, who needs harmony and stability.  Number 6 should not allow themselves them at the mercy of Number 5's whims, but should be more assertive about their own needs. 

Number 6 should be aware that a relationship with Number 5 holds no guarantee of lasting and should be prepared for disappointment.

A relationship between Number 5 and Number 6 should be approached lightly by both individuals.  They should enjoy it while it lasts and not have too many expectations of each other.
