If you love to socialize this is the place for you! 5 loves to party so there is never a dull moment. 5 is the most gregarious of all the numbers so this is a great place for people who love having people over and entertaining guests. There are always surprises with 5, so if you love excitement and adventure, you’ve found the right place. Perfect for those who love to travel, meet new people, try new things, and enjoy your freedom. If you want to break up your routine, get out of a rut, or just have fun, you’ve found the right home!

Challenges: If you’re looking for quiet, reflection, or stability, you won’t find it here. You might find this to be a temporary home rather than a permanent one. Because 5 promotes variety and change, you might find it difficult to make up your mind or focus on practical matters.

You might find yourself over-indulging in food, sex, or alcohol, especially if your home ads up to 14, which is a karmic lesson number. Avoid a 5 home if you are prone to addiction of any sort. If you maintain your discipline and stay focused on your personal goals, you will find the right balance.
