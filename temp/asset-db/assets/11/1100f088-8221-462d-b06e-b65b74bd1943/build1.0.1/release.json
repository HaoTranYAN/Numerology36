            "People with number 5 missing in their name have karmic lesson number 5. At first impression they seem self-seeking people. These people with karmic lesson number 5 are not adventurous and thus need to be more courageous. They should travel more often and broaden their horizons. This will also make them more social and experience change which they need to accept. Travelling will also require them to adapt to various circumstances in their lives.\n\nThey are very obstinate and stubborn. The lesson these people need to learn is to have more faith. Be more cheerful and grow by adapting to changes.\n\nThese people attract good karma as they have the tendency of not being limelight- hungry and sometimes quite happily give the spotlight to others knowing that those people are quite inferior and less talented than them.\n\nAlso they should be less critical and opinionated about others and let others voice their opinions. A person lacking number 5 in their name should learn to be modest and humble. If a person has number five in their core numbers such as Personality Number or Birthday minimum once, the effect of their karmic number decreases."
