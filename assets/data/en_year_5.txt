Personal Year 5: Changes

Personal Year 5 is basically a break from the past 4 vibrations. This cycle is focused on liberation and change. You may have a feeling of being loose or free.

During this year, necessary things you worked on previously will move into their rightful position in your life, both internally and externally.
