            "You landed in this kind of karmic debt due to your abuse power of relationships in the journey of your past life. The need to repay this karma debt will cause you to feel the urge or need to prove that you are worthy of trust in this lifetime. You might be dealing with such obstacles if you allowed your arrogance to get the better of you in the past. Lessons of learning humility and be of service will be needed to clear this debt. Remember, you hold the power.\n\nThis is among the hardest to overcome since you need to be in touch with your inner self to understand the need to gain humility. You likely were involved in several affairs in your other life and broke the trust of several friends and family members in the process.\n\nOn the other hand, similar to other karmic debts, clearing your name requires thorough self-reflection. Think about the many times your arrogance has got you into trouble or how frequently your self-perception has offended others. Come to peace with that and start by thinking less about yourself. While it might take some time before you overcome your ego-related problems, remaining consistent will help you to transform your habits and in response become a trustworthy individual.\n\nSome issues that you may continue to encounter with this karmic debt include hard-headedness, desire to be in solitude, lack of reliance, negative energies, struggles with interaction, failed relationships, difficulty in sustaining emotional connections, and egocentric."
