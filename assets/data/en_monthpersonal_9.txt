Endings, Completions, Transformations
Time to let go of the old or what is no longer serving you! It’s time to release and make room for the new. Let go of bad habits, people, or ways of doing things. New opportunities are waiting for you but cannot arrive until you let go of the old ways and things. This is also a month to be of service to others. Volunteer your money, time, or services to those in need. Forgive the misfortune in your life and move on. Don’t carry that negative energy with you. Your 1 month is right around the corner!
