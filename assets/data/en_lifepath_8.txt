<color=#FFC90E><b>The Professional</b></color>

Eights place emphasis on career, business, finances and authority. You are spiritual, but maintain a practicality and realism to your spirituality. You know the difference between make-believe and genuine realizations. However, you are also perfectly balanced and are a force that creates as easily as it destroys.

Eights focus on money, however, this is not as simple as it seems. You see money as a measure, not an end-result. You find happiness in luxury and believe your career success will lead to a more comfortable life. You are ambitious, efficient, organized and disciplined and willing to take on any task. You enjoy counseling others and sharing your wisdom and often find yourself in a “coach” type role.

However, Eights can only flourish when supported. While your ambition may make you a great leader and mentor, you are lost if you have no followers. Eights who become too independent or are not given the necessary support at a young age rebel against everything that they are. Often choosing a path that is limited and has no room for growth. This leads to frustration, anger, dissatisfaction, and hate.

You are a pack animal and you do best when part of a team. You are naturally balanced and must surround yourself with people who maintain this. You have great potential for success, however, with too much independence or ego, you have an equal potential for failure.
