Change, Adventure & Movement
Time to step out of your comfort zone! Everything is changing! That’s okay, be adventurous and try new things. You may actually enjoy them. Be flexible and adaptable instead of rigid to harness the magic of this 5 month. Change is a-happenin’ and you may as well make the most of it! Prioritize your time, be social and promote yourself, but don’t over-extend yourself by having your finger in too many pies. If there are changes you need to make in your life, now is the time to make them.
