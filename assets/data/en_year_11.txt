Personal Year 11: Spiritual Inspiration

Year 11 only comes up once in a blue moon. This bonus cycle, as some call it, instills within you a higher level of spirituality. This will then give you the energy to inspire others around you.

You will also be able to develop your intuitive skills so far as to uncover and detect subtle feelings many cannot. In year 11, you will also be able to recognize opportunities from literally everything you encounter.

It's a pretty big deal of a personal year number to get.
