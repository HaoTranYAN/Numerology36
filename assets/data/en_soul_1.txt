Soul urge number one signifies independence and self-sufficiency. It is the sign of a great leader. Someone who’s confident in their abilities, unafraid to make difficult decisions.

If you have a heart’s desire number 1, then your soul urge is to be a leader.

But soul number 1 is not without its challenges. A strong leader requires a loyal following. Your enthusiasm is infectious and your commitment inspires others to action. However, you may come into conflict with people who don’t like being led. If your soul number is one, you may also have a competitive streak, which may need to be tamed at times.
