In a relationship between a Number 1 and a Number 5, the main area of difficulty for this combination is initial attraction.  There is little about Number 1 that Number 5 will find attractive.  Number 5 will tend to regard Number 1 as a bit of a 'cold fish'.  Number 1 is unlikely to find Number 5's approach to life acceptable as Number 5 is too irresponsible for Number 1.

If this pair do actually get together and they decide to commit to each other, the relationship has a fair chance of being successful.

If Number 5 does fall for Number 1, they will have accepted the Number 1 for what and who they are, and will need to accept that they will always have their differences.

A relationship with Number 5 may bring out another side to Number 1's character.  They may become more relaxed and carefree with Number 5 as a partner.

Number 5 will be affectionate and supportive of Number 1, and Number 1 will appreciate this attention.  Number 1 should remember to pay attention to their partner aswell.

There is a danger that Number 5 will look elsewhere for affection if they feel that Number 1 is being neglectful.  Number 1 should always make the time to spend with their partner and not become too obsessed with work.

Once the few minor problems have been sorted out, Number 1 and Number 5 will lead a happy life together.  As long as Number 1 continues to put in effort, this should be a lasting union.
