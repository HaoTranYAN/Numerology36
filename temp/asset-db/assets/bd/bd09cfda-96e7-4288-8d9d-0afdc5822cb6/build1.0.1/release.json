            "<color=#FFC90E><b>The Organizer</b></color>\n\nFours are orderly and methodical and base their lives in logic. If you’re a Four, you are the epitome of stability. You use hard work and reason to establish a solid foundation and believe any problem can be overcome with a proper plan. Often thought to be a more masculine number, the 4’s shape says it all – hard linear edges with no room for flow or flexibility.\n\nFours are trustworthy and patient people. While always dependable, their constant obedience and commitment to discipline can also make them seem boring. However, Fours often possess an entertainingly witty and dry sense of humor. You find happiness in your proven accomplishments, favoring results over any sort of reward or recognition. You are humble and can be overlooked easily, even when you are the foundation to others successes. But you don’t mind. Fours dislike public attention and are quite happy to keep doing what they’re doing. However, your rigidity and stubbornness also make you a fierce soldier when defending your territory.\n\nDue to an under-developed sense of imagination, Fours often have narrow-minded or conventional views. You have an aversion to the unexpected and see no reason to stray from something that already works. Because of your dislike for change, you hold rules as sacred. You feel safe and secure when things are predictable, and even small changes have the ability to throw your life into chaos. While Fours may not end up being the CEO of a company, their hard work, loyalty and dependability will certainly carry them far in their career."
