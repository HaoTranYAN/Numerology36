Number 3 and Number 5 will be instantly attracted to each other.  They are both flirtatious by nature, and they will enjoy each other's company. 

If the initial flirtation develops into a more serious relationship they may experience some difficulties. 

The main problem for Number 3 will be Number 5's apparent lack of interest and attention. In order to get a reaction from Number 5, Number 3 may flirt with other people. Rather than become jealous, Number 5 may well do just the same, which will deeply hurt Number 3, and seemingly confirm their fear that Number 5 simply does not care.

Neither Number 5 nor Number 3 is suited to difficult relationships, as they both tend to move on to avoid problems.

In order for this relationship to work, both Number 3 and Number 5 will need to talk about their feelings and be open with each other, and Number 3 will need reassurance and affection.  If Number 3 and Number 5 put in the effort, there is a fair chance that the relationship will succeed.  How long the relationship lasts really depends upon the level of commitment of the two individuals involved.
