If the vowels in your name contain soul number 9, then you’re deeply concerned with global consciousness.

You might be driven by serving others to the detriment of your own needs. You have incredible mental clarity. This allows you to see things from a much broader perspective than others might.

The vibrational energy of number 9 is very strong. Sometimes, it may overpower your more selfish drives. As a result, you may be more idealistic, generous and unselfish than others.

Important aspects of your destiny are associated with going on an inner journey. This involves self-analysis and attaining important inner realisations. If you harness the full potential of your heart’s desire number, you will leave this world a better place.
