During this period you will likely be consumed with hard work, your eyes fixed an a specific prize or list of prizes. You will be chiefly concerned with the practical aspects of life: family, career, reputation, etc. You will have no overtly idealistic pursuits. In fact, your goals are so concrete you can clearly see the road ahead and the finish line that waits on the horizon. Be careful not to get stuck in a rut (and you will be prone to do just that) as they can and will impede your progress toward your goals. Do what makes you happy and the “stuff” will follow. You will also be respected by your family and your peers for your ability to balance every part of your life.
