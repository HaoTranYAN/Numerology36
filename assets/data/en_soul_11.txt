Soul number 11 is known as a master number.

If your heart’s desire number is 11 then you are on a unique spiritual journey in this lifetime. (More so than all the other soul urge numbers.)

You have a well-developed sense of morality. Your strong intuition helps you understand the fleeting nature of the physical world. You intuitively know that we are all part of a bigger picture.

11 is a number with incredible power and strength. But acquiring that strength and growing into it can be difficult. Most people with heart’s desire number 11 start off in difficult circumstances. Your childhood may not have been a happy one, but wrought with trials. Your journey may not have been an easy one. However, through your suffering you have become wiser.

Now that you’re an adult you can solve problems effectively. You make solid judgments because you’ve been through so much.
