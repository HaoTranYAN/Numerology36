<color=#FFC90E><b>The Free Spirit</b></color>

Fives are a whirlwind of energy, constantly in need of change and stimulation. If you are a Five, your family and friends probably view you as independent and unpredictable. You’re always up for an adventure and aren’t averse to taking risks. While you are surprisingly loyal, you can also be selfish, thoughtless and irresponsible, leaving a wake of damage for others to clean up.

For Fives, change is a necessity. You have an uncompromising need for freedom and you will not be told what to do. This often makes careers a struggle. You may flit from job to job before finding your path, and even then there is no guarantee. You do best in environments that suit your need for change and independence such as consulting or owning your own business. However, once you put your mind to something, friends and family are impressed by your dedication and focus.

You are adaptable, smart and progressive and your respect for independence is reflected in your tolerant nature. However, this tolerance also makes you more likely to trust the wrong people. Fives are a poor judge of character and are often drawn to eccentric, unstable people. Your desire for instant gratification is usually your downfall, but with discipline and a stable family-like structure this can be avoided.
