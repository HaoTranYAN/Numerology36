  "text": "Minor setbacks, forks in the road, hard decisions â€“ all of these will comprise this period of your life. Approach life and work with an attitude of benevolence. Your willingness to keep switching gears and roll with life's punches will lead to success. Some of the best ideas can be forged during periods of personal introspection and circumstance can give birth to opportunities you may never see coming until they present. When they do, be ready and dive into them. Other people will look to you as their example so set good ones in everything you do."
