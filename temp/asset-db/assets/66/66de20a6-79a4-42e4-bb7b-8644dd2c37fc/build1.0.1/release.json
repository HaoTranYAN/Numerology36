            "A person who has the number 1 missing from his or her name has the Karmic Lesson number 1. This person is weak-willed and not firm. Thus such a person needs to learn to show more initiative and determination.\n\nThese individuals need to start making their own decisions and be less dependent. They will come in contact with many strong-minded people and thus one will either need to learn to be self-confident and insistent or get suppressed. This karmic lesson number is missing from the name only to teach these people to be more dynamic and assertive. Learn to uphold yourself among others and exude confidence.\n\nLearning not to be timid in front of others and being concerned with what the other person thinks needs to be shirked off. Be more confident about your abilities, decision- making and rationality. Also do not procrastinate. A person with this karmic lesson number needs to develop faith in oneself and be more methodical.\n\nThe effect of any karmic lesson diminishes if this number is present once in any of the other core numbers such as Life Path, Destiny number, or Birthday."
