Relationships, Emotions & Balance
Patience is a big theme this month! It’s a good idea to take a step back and don’t force things to happen. Work on what you’ve already created, looking at the finer details behind the scenes. This includes relationships…seeking balance, peace, and harmony within them. Try and be cooperative with others and heal past hurts. Express your emotions in a healthy way. Be open to giving and receiving love.
