If you’re a three, you’re the star of the party and liven up any room without even trying. You have a natural gift for creativity and you are well aware of your talent. However, Threes are also a bit like spoiled teenagers. They are disorganized, in need of constant guidance, and blissfully unaware or ungrateful for the efforts others go through to protect them.\n\nYour powerful need to express yourself coupled with your extroverted personality will most likely lead you to a career in the arts or sales (a verbal art, if you will). Your charm, wit and sense of humor will get you everywhere and it often helps others to forgive or overlook your less desirable traits. You are a natural optimist and people are drawn to your positive energy.\n\nHowever, for Threes, your greatest asset is also your greatest weakness. Because your charisma and natural talent come easily, you find it difficult to understand and relate to the struggles others. While you are always well liked and have a large group of friends, you may find it hard to form deeper relationships, especially with a romantic partner. Your need for expression and your natural creativity cause you to often lack focus and procrastinate. You find yourself involved in multiple projects at a time, abandoning the old for the new with no regard for others involved. By placing their attention on the sunny exterior and failing to form spiritual depth, Threes easily succumb to difficulties or challenges.\n\nTo become well rounded and happy, Threes must learn discipline and put constant effort into maintaining deeper relationships."
