For the Number 1 and Number 4 to succeed in a long-term relationship, both individuals will need to be committed to each other and to making the relationship work.

The main problem or obstacle facing this partnership is that both individuals wish to be dominant and to control the other.  Neither party can accept another person trying to dictate to them, and this could be the source of much disharmony.

Number 4's temper could give Number 1 reason to doubt the suitability of the match and may lead to a permanent rift.  Number 4 should learn to manage anger in a way that does not create conflict in the relationship.

By nature, both Number 1 and Number 4 are reluctant to be open about their emotions and so the relationship between the two may seem to lack open affection.

Number 1 and Number 4 should try to trust their partner and to be honest about how they are feeling.

This is a relationship that needs to be worked at to succeed long term, but if the effort is put in, then it could be rewarding for both parties.
