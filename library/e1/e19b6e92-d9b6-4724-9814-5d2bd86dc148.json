  "text": "A person with Karmic Lesson number 2 has the number missing in his/her name. This person suffers from not being tactful and perceptive. These people thus need to learn to be diplomatic and manage different situations better. They need to know when to tone down and when to be assertive, without feeling any need to be rewarded or praised. They also need to learn to be part of a team and to cooperate with others. People with karmic lesson number 2, have a tendency to be self-centered. They also need to let go of their angers and resentments to have a more stable and less troubled adult life.\n\nThese people need to be more compassionate and sensitive towards the feelings of others and understand their sentiments. They will mostly find themselves in circumstances where they will have to put to use their attention and patience that will help them coordinate work with others and be more supportive and accommodating.\n\nThe effect of this karmic lesson number will lessen if this person has the number 2 in any of his or her core numbers such as Birthday, Personality number or Life Path."
