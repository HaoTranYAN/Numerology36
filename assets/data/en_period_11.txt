This will be a time when you expand your horizons and become open to new ways of looking at life and spirit. You will have new revelations and discover answers to many needling questions. You will have a keen sense of purpose and feel very in tune with the world around you as well as the greater Universe that envelops you. In the midst of these mountaintop experiences, you will need to consciously keep your feet on the ground. Do not lose sight of those concrete and practical things that have brought you here in the first place. Do not jeopardize career and family for the sake of Becoming. That will happen when you achieve the proper balance and can see all of these things working in tandem to move you forward in all aspects of life.
