  "text": "Do sad movies make you cry? Do you often switch off the news? If youâ€™ve done the calculations with your name and vowels, and ended up with a soul number 2, you are a sensitive and emotional soul.\n\nYour greatest desire is to feel secure and comfortable. While you may sometimes despise your sensitivity, behind it hides a wonderful asset. Your powerful intuition. You need to learn to trust it, and stand up for what you believe is right because your judgments are often spot on!"
