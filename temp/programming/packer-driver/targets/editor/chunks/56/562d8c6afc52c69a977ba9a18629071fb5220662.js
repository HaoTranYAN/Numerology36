        "MEANING": "In simple terms, numerology is the study of numbers in your life. You can uncover information about the world and also each individual person by using Numerology.\n\nNumerology is seen as a universal language of numbers.\n\nNumerology can look incredibly complex, and there are so many different types of Numerology that you may not even know where to start, but if you are familiar with Astrology, then you may know a little bit about Numerology; it is similar in quite a few ways but uses a different method to get the information and insight: Numbers. Numerology is the idea that the universe is a system and once broken down we are left with the basic elements, which are numbers.\n\nThese numbers can then be used to help us to better understand the world and ourselves as individuals.",
