            "If you are a mystic, writer, researcher, or spiritual seeker of any sort, you will love living here. 7 is a private vibration, and can be somewhat secretive. It inspires deep thought, reflection, and powerful insight. If you love to come home and have quiet time to read, reflect and restore, you will thrive here!\n\nTo promote tranquility, water is a lovely element to add to this home, if you don’t already live near a body of water. You can have some thrilling spiritual and intellectual insights here, so it is a wonderful home to promote dramatic shifts in your consciousness.\n\nChallenges: If you like entertaining, or love to party, you can find yourself going a little stir-crazy. You might find it is too isolating or lonely at times. It is important that you eliminate any clutter in your environment as well as your thoughts to harmonize with your home’s energy.\n\nMake sure to take good care of your roof and make all necessary repairs, since 7 homes are prone to roof damage – particularly if it is an address that adds up to 16, which is a karmic lesson number. Since 7s love to escape, you would want to avoid this address if you are prone to alcohol or drug addictions."
