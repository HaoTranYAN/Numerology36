            "The rarest of all master numbers, 33 is the ‘master teacher’.\n\nThe most spiritually evolved of all numbers, it exemplifies the nurturing and loving qualities of soul urge number 6.\n\nIf you have this number as your soul urge, then you’re very loyal and understanding. An attentive listener, you always try to see the best in people and forgive easily.\n\nYou tend to put everyone else’s needs above your own (sometimes to your detriment). You seek out beauty and harmony in all things. You are drawn to the arts, since artistic expression brings you immense satisfaction.\n\nBut, despite all the talents that you possess, the life path of soul urge 33 is not always easy. Your abilities may not fully manifest until you reach the age of 35. Life is calling you to step into a leadership position that will enable you to serve the world."
