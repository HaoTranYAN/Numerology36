<color=#FFC90E><b>Life’s Purpose for Ruling Birth Number 8</b></color>

One of the most important aspects of love is our ability to express it. One of the most vital components to successful human relationships is a fluent expression of appreciation (itself a vital embodiment of love). It is in these two avenues of expression that Ruling Birth Number 8 people find greatest difficulty. Consequently, an essential feature of their purpose in life is to transcend these limitations. Growth in this direction will develop with the realization that, rather than inhibiting their independence, such improved relationships strengthen the confidence others have in them. In turn, this creates greater personal security and improved happiness in their lives, together with growth in wisdom, which is so essential to a Ruling Birth Number 8.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Best Expression</b></color>

Seemingly inconsistent for Ruling Birth Number 8’s is their enormous capacity for compassion and sympathetic tenderness for those in trouble. However, not always do they express themselves in this manner for long, tending to grow impatient with those who become dependent upon them. This, they feel, hampers their own independence. They have the ability to be enormously successful in business, particularly if they do not let their emotional misunderstandings interfere with their commercial decision making. Ruling Birth Number 8 people are noticeably conscious of their dress, taking great pride in appearance, both of themselves and their loved ones. They are feeling people who often tend to hide their sensitivities until they become mature enough to express them.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Distinctive Traits</b></color>

A strong air of independence and dependability, together with a self-confident manner, are distinctive of Ruling Birth Number 8 people. These qualities work in harmony to equip them for positions of seniority and responsibility in which many are found to excel. But their fierce independence can often transmute to an undemonstrative attitude of coolness, bordering on indifference, in the home. This is related to their difficulty in self-expression, an inhibition that usually diminishes with maturity. Their inherent love for the more helpless creatures – animals, infants, the elderly and the sick – is constantly seeking expression and will instantly convert aloofness into loving kindness. Ruling Birth Number 8’s also possess a wealth of natural wisdom from which they learn to reliably draw from as they mature.


<color=#FFC90E><b>Negative Tendencies to Be Surmounted</b></color>

Their fierce independence is so zealously guarded that these people develop a deep resentment toward any form of (what they regard as) interference with their plans. Therefore, great diplomacy and tact should be used by those who seek to guide them. Indeed, Ruling Birth Number 8 people need a great deal of guidance, especially in their handling of children – they are either overindulgent or exceptionally strict. They often find difficulty in their love relationships, tending to create a barrier and hold their feelings in close check. As they mature, they realise how much happier they can be with the natural expression of their loving feelings.

Every effort should be made to overcome the undemonstrativeness they so often exhibit towards their loved ones. This is best achieved through awareness of its existence, for many Ruling Birth Number 8 people do not see themselves as undemonstrative. As they learn to express their feelings more fluently, their happiness and personal security improve. Appreciation, expressed in the first person, is an excellent means of developing the expression of their deeper feelings. With this growth will develop the overall wisdom that, hitherto, they have tended only to express in impersonal situations, such as in business or in giving advice to others.
