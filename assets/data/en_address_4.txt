This is a solid, secure, protected environment. 4 is the most grounded vibration of all, and relates to the earth, real estate and physical structures. This would be a great place for investments, whether it is related to properties, stocks, finances, or even your education. Discipline, structure, and responsibility are supported here.

If you are growing your business, finances or family, this is a great home for you. This is a wonderful place if you prefer stability to change, or at least want your home to be conventional, even if the rest of your life is adventurous!

Challenges: 4 is the slowest and most grounded of all the numbers, so if you like adventure, variety, excitement, or innovation, you won’t find it here. You might find yourself working too hard or getting too bogged down in your to-do list, particularly if you live in a 13 home, which is a karmic lesson number.

It’s important that you balance work with play, and practicality with emotions. Since 4 relates to structure, you want to make sure the physical frame and foundation of your home are in good shape.  Don’t skimp on home repairs if you need them.
