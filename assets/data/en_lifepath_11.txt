<color=#FFC90E><b>The Energetic Visionary</b></color>

Elevens are the most intuitive of all Life Path Numbers and can sense a great deal about whatâ€™s going on behind the scenes. They have an innate understanding of others and are easily able to pick up on deeper cues. As a master number, Elevens have similar qualities to Twos, only amplified. You are dedicated and loyal and are likely to marry young. This amplified intuition is fueled by an unyielding energy, which makes it hard for others to sometimes keep up.

Because of your natural intuition and constant energy, you are likely to live a life of extremes. You form deep relationships easily, often at the bewilderment of others. However, this life of extremes is also driven by an inner restlessness. You are a visionary with energy to spare and when you become bored you plunge yourself into the next great idea. This gives you both power and emotional turmoil.

However, you possess more potential than you know. You have a natural ability to develop deep and accurate insights without ever going through a rational thought process. This is often misunderstood at a young age, leading many Elevens to be self-conscious and self-criticizing.

Your sensitivity and high-energy make you prone to anxiety and stress. While you are always tactful and diplomatic, your anxiety can make you quick to feel slighted or attacked. You often envision ways to fight back, however, your intuition will usually keep you from making any sudden movements. Take care to give yourself ample time to decompress when faced with stressful situations. You must find balance between the extremes to find your calm.
