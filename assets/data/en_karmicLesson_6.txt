Those individuals who have number 6 missing from their name have this number as their karmic lesson number. On first impression people with this number seem as social climbers. People with this missing number do not like commitment. They are also irresponsible. Marriage and commitment to other personal relationships are things these people run away from. They should learn to be more open about their emotions.

These people feel lonely and isolated but have no reason for such a feeling. The reason for this kind of a feeling is that they very often form strong bonds with a person but remain heavily guarded about it. They show no affection towards them by concealing their true feelings and seeming cold. They also take the relationships for granted that in turn makes it superficial. Thus they should learn to work towards a relationship seriously.

They need to learn the importance of friends and value them. They should learn to give in a relationship and sometimes even sacrifice to keep their relationships intact.

Those who have this number once or repeated in their core numbers such as Life Path or birthday have the effect of karmic lesson reduced.
