As the Master Number of the Master Builder, 22 is the number of STABILITY. This number governs all things related to the Earth, including finances, career, your physical body and family. This is a wonderful home if you have a close family, want to feel more grounded, or wish to connect with the natural world. This is a power spot if you are an entrepreneur or teacher. This home is best decorated with natural elements, and designed with access to the natural world.

Challenges: Because 22 is a master number, you will have some spiritual trials that will test your strength. You might feel a lot of pressure to provide for your family, or stress from work.

If you shy away from your leadership or teaching role, you will face some authority issues, until you accept your responsibilities. You might find yourself working too hard or too focused on your career or family obligations. If you learn to delegate some of your tasks, and create a balance of work and play, you will find your key to happiness.

Remember, most of all, home is where the heart is!

If you live in or near nature that nurtures your soul or close to the people you love, you will always feel at home.
