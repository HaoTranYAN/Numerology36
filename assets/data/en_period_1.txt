This period of your life will be very intense. It will test your limits and force you to develop various strengths and virtues. You will have a clear vision of your dreams and aspirations and will have to stay focused and committed, using every ounce of your talent and will. You will be tested around every turn but you will be able to dodge every obstacle. Every difficulty you face will make you stronger. You will find yourself constantly asserting and fighting to maintain your independence and sense of personal identity but, in the end, it will be a well-fought battle. Much progress will be made and much will be experienced and learned.
