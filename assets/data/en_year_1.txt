Personal Year 1: New Beginnings

Cycle 1 has a focused energy on new beginnings, opportunities, and independence. This is the year you will usually end up doing things on your own and in your own way, not really relying on others.

It's the year of fresh starts and clean slates. You may move, you may get a new job, or you may meet new people that will impact your life.
