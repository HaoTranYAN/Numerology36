You have an insatiable need for independence. You are determined to be the master of your own destiny. You are determined to live life on your terms. You not only have leadership qualities, but in many situations consider yourself to be the only qualified leader. This instills you with confidence and helps you make difficult decisions that others would be apprehensive about making

Your intelligence is above average and people regard you as being insightful and even inspiring. The leader in you draws out the follower in others. People look to you for your unique perspectives and actually appreciate the controversial nature of some of them. When you believe in something, you commit to it and your enthusiasm is infectious.

The negative in all this is that the things you know about yourself and your abilities can make you come across as arrogant or domineering. Be sure to gather around you people who want to be led. Competition can bring out parts of your personality best left out of public view.
