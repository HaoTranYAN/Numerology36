            "Promotes independence, innovation, ingenuity, ambition, drive and leadership. This is a wonderful home to live in if you are self employed and work out of your home. This is also a great home if there are people living together who wish to maintain their autonomy and freedom. Living here can strengthen your character, determination and self-confidence.\n\nChallenges: If you would like to promote cooperation and harmony, the 1 can foster too much independence. If you want to find a partner, or are prone to loneliness, this home can have too much “self” energy and not as much partnering. If you find yourself feeling unsupported and having too much work, your home may add up to 19.\n\nThis is a karmic lesson number.  You can easily create more welcoming supportive energy in your home for others by having art that depicts more than one person, animal or object instead of someone or something singular. This also serves as a reminder to your subconscious that you enjoy the company of others."
