If you got soul number 7 after adding up each vowel, then you are most likely a very independent person.

You detest beliefs that are based on ‘thin air’. You need tangible evidence before you believe anything. Your analytical mind allows you to delve deeper into issues than other people might. You are on a constant path of self-development. You may even be looking to attain enlightenment.

You seek the truth, always. You ask deep, meaningful questions that may take a lifetime to answer. You may struggle to express your feelings (since these are not ‘tangible’). You need a partner who will give you space and independence you crave. Neediness does not go down well with you.
