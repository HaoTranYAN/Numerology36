Number 7 is an unlikely target for the attentions of Number 6.  Number 7 is too quiet and withdrawn for Number 6, who is looking for someone who stands out from the crowd.  Likewise, Number 6 will not impress Number 7, who will be suspicious of Number 6's polished and perfected image.  In fact, it is unlikely that these two will find themselves at the same function.

If Number 6 and Number 7 do find themselves attracted to each other and decide to become romantically involved then they will probably be surprised at how well they get on.  Number 7 is very romantic individual, and Number 6 will be flattered by their attentions and feel more confident about expressing their emotions. 

Number 6 will feel supported and loved by Number 7 but should remember to be attentive in return.

Problems will only arise if Number 7 feels unappreciated by Number 6, and becomes insecure.  Number 7 is able to express unhappiness in an emotional way and Number 6 will not be able to cope with the resulting disharmony.  Number 6 should reassure Number 7 of their love on a regular basis and not just on birthdays and anniversaries and the like.

Once Number 6 and Number 7 have worked through their initial difficulties, they will be happy together.  They will share an affectionate and loving relationship.
