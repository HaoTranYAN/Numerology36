  "text": "You are the life of the party â€“ happy, outgoing, and very personable. People find you inspiring and entertaining and your self-expression skills show themselves in your words. Some people hang on your words but you need to be careful not to over-use your words. You have the tendency to run off at the mouth quite a bit when you are nervous or experiencing an abundance of ego. Those words of yours would be best served in avenues like writing, acting and public speaking.\n\nYou are extremely creative so find an appropriate outlet for your creativity. Those abilities will need to be reined in if you are going to make best use of them. Without focus, you have a tendency to become disorganized and that could leave some of your talents severely under-utilized."
