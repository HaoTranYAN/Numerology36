Rest, Introspection, Personal & Spritual Growth
Take a step back from the craziness in your life and recharge. Spend some quiet time thinking about your life purpose and how you can improve your life. Get in touch with your spiritual side (maybe through meditation and prayer), and focus on becoming a better person. Work on improving your health through alternative modalities like yoga and meditation.
