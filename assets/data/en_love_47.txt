If Number 4 and Number 7 find themselves romantically involved with each other, the chances are that their relationship will become a serious commitment before too long.

Number 7 will probably fall head over heels in love with Number 4 and will declare undying love and devotion.  Number 4 will be flattered and will not doubt suggest making the relationship more official.  This process of making a long-term commitment to each other may happen over a very short time, and may in fact be far too quick.  Number 4 and Number7 should try to put on the brakes a little, and think seriously about their compatibility and their future together before becoming too involved.

If Number 4 and Number 7 do decide to go ahead and make a commitment to each other, they will generally be happy together. 

Number 7 is a very open and emotional individual who will constantly reassure Number 4 of his or her love. Number 4 is not naturally confident about discussing affairs of the heart, but may feel so secure in Number 7's love that they are willing to open up.  If Number 4 is not open with Number 7, Number 7 may become insecure and doubt that they are loved by their partner.  Number 4 should try to find a way to express emotions and Number 7 should accept that not everyone is able to be open emotionally.

There is a danger in this relationship that Number 4 will try to be the dominant partner, and impose their will on Number 7.  Number 7 will rebel against any attempts at control by Number 4.  Number 4 should avoid adopting a domineering role, or real problems could arise in the relationship. 

Number 4 and Number 7 will generally be happy together, and their relationship should stand the test of time.  Their relationship would be strengthened if they find leisure interests that they can share.
