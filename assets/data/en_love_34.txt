It is unlikely that Number 3 and Number 4 will be attracted to each other immediately, as they have very different interests and attitudes, and share little common ground.

Number 3 tends to flirt and have brief affairs, while Number 4 is more interested in settling down into a secure and long-term relationship.

If Number 3 and Number 4 do become romantically involved, they will run into difficulties almost immediately.

Number 3 expects romance and passion and may find Number 4 too reserved.  Number 4 will feel insecure in a relationship with Number 3, and will be suspicious and jealous of Number 3 flirting with other people.

Number 4 may attempt to dominate and control Number 3 in order to create a relationship that is stable and secure.  This, however, is more likely to send Number 3 into the arms of another admirer.  Number 3 is an independent individual who needs space and freedom, and will react badly to domineering behaviour.

In order for this relationship to work, both individuals need to be absolutely committed to each other, and they need to be willing to put in a great deal of effort.  These two need to communicate with each other, and to talk through their emotions.  They also need to accommodate each other's differences and accept each other for who and what they are.
