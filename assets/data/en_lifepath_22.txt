<color=#FFC90E><b>The Master Builder</b></color>

If your Life Path Number is Twenty Two, you have the potential for extreme success and power. You are well disciplined, ambitious, confident and pragmatic, all of which make you naturally able to turn dreams into realities. As a master number, Twenty Twos share a lot of the same characteristics as Fours. You are hard working and rooted in logic, breaking down complex situations into step-by-step solutions. However, unlike Fours, Twenty Twos have a natural gift for intuition and independence, which allows them to overcome social anxieties.

As a Twenty Two, you are able to see the beauty of an idea as well as the logistics to make it a reality. However, your sound common sense also makes it easy for you to see the limitations of an idea. Your hard work and dedication to analysis help you understand complex scenarios, such as the intricacies of a large organization or global network. While others may not always see your vision, your intuition and realism make it easy for you to build trust. You are a dreamer and a pragmatist all in one.

Unfortunately, Twenty Twos are often the most unfulfilled in life. You are aware of your potential, however you are also your own harshest critic. You often set impractical and unrealistic standards for yourself, placing a constant self-imposed pressure to succeed. You have great difficulty accepting failure of any sort and usually blame yourself, even when itâ€™s not deserved. When unchecked, your ego can also lead to distrust of others. You see yourself as superior and therefore lack faith in the ability of others.

Twenty Twos are dedicated and disciplined visionaries. However, you must learn to accept that ideas may change and transform as they come to fruition. Variations from your original vision are opportunities, not failures.
